// Fred and George collected <result> sweets
// There are <result> stars in the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies.
// With bonus marks, Ron scored <result>/10 on his potions test. Snape wasn't too thrilled
// Fred has  <result>  more sweets than George
// The Andromeda Galaxy has <result> more stars than the Milky Way
// Snape ended up removing marks. Ron actually scored <result> on his potions test
// Fred and George used a special spell to multiply their sweets to: <result>
// Snape made an error on his excel, accidentally multiplying Ron's score to: <result>/10
// Originally, Fred had  <result> times more sweets than George
// Andromeda has <result> times more stars
// Snape caught the error. Furious, he divided Ron's score to: <result>
